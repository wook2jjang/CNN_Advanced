국민대학교 데이터사이언스학과 딥러닝 스터디 week03 입니다.
필요한 부분은 스탠포드 대학의 CS231n의 lecture note를 참조하였습니다.

## This study is not for understanding all the mathematical details

– This study is for …
• Understanding the core theory and the model (of deep learning)
• Improve your programming skill (to make your own model with Pytorch)

– So, we are going to review many codes in detail (line by line)
• Also, you have to implement by yourself!
• Even if you continue to refer to the code published on Github, typing directly while reflecting on the 
meaning of each line is different from simply copying and pasting.
